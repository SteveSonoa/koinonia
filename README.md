# koinonia
An online gameshow involving 2 pastors and a special celebrity guest!

We'll have 2 youth pastors involved in a head-to-head competition. Multiple games.
Some games will have the celebrity as a spoiler answering trivia questions.
Some questions will be about the celebrity.
Some games will bounce back & forth with celebrity asking questions to pastor 1, then pastor 2, then pastor 1, etc.
Ask about each person's prayer life
Ask about each person's devotional life
Ask for a prayer request from each
Ask: What is your favorite part of your job?
Ask celeb: What is your favorite memory seeing God work?

THE GAMES
Round 1: 10 points per correct answer. General Trivia, involving all 3 players (celeb is a spoiler)
Round 2: 25 points per won round. Celeb becomes host & goes through back & forth questions (name colors I like, etc). Round 1 & 3: Biblical. Round 2: Personal to celeb (ice cream flavors I like, etc)
Round 3: There are 2 categories. The player behind chooses the category. The player ahead chooses which one of them will answer the question. A right answer wins - a wrong answer loses.


VIEWS
MAIN VIEWER: Video streams of all participants, name, company (church, band, etc), job title, score, buzzer indicator, question/answer viewing area, right/wrong indicator
PLAYER VIEWER: name, company, job title, score, buzzer indicator, BIG buzzer button, q/a viewing area (also doubles for messages from HOST), right/wrong indicator
HOST VIEWER: name, company, title, score, buzzer indicator, buzzer reset button, q/a to send to all, messages to send to one or more players, right/wrong selector


PRIZES
Winning pastor will get $500 scholarship for students to go to camp, split as pastor sees appropriate

SUBSCRIBERS ONLY
15-30 minutes after game ends, celeb will answer questions from subscribers
This video is only available to subscribers
Questions can be asked in text format, or they can video themselves asking the question
These should be done 1 week before showing so I have the chance to filter through them
Subscribers get to create avatars for the website game - users get to choose an icon
Preparation for each video is also available to subscribers only


WEBSITE
Each player has their own page with a buzzer button - hit the button, and it will show up who hit it first. I have a reset switch.
Live stream on YouTube with emotes & subs.
Patreon exists, too.
Other people can play online, too - build app. High score table.
Shop for clothes, merch, etc.


SPECIAL
Occasionally bring Koinonia to camp! Have 2 pastors face off against a member of the band or the lead pastor.
Film it & add to YouTube later.
